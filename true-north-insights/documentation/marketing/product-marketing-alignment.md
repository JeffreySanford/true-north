## Cross-Functional Operating Rhythm

| Cadence   | Focus                            | Participants                 | Output               |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Bi-Weekly | Capability → Pillar validation   | Product, Marketing, Security | Updated mapping log  |
| Monthly   | Proof artifact refresh planning  | Product Marketing, Eng       | Refresh task list    |
| Quarterly | Narrative resonance via win/loss | Capture, Product, Exec       | Pillar adjustments   |

## Backlog Prioritization Heuristic

Score = (Pillar Coverage Breadth × Weight) + (External Proof Gap × Weight) + (Risk Reduction × Weight) - (Complexity × Weight)

| Factor                  | Scale | Weight | Notes                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Pillar Coverage Breadth | 1-3   | 3      | # distinct pillars advanced            |
| External Proof Gap      | 1-3   | 2      | Addresses missing or stale artifact    |
| Risk Reduction          | 1-2   | 2      | Compliance / performance / reliability |
| Complexity              | 1-3   | 2      | Higher = subtract more                 |

## Immediate Actions

1. Validate maturity column with engineering leads.
2. Stand up shared mapping log (temporary spreadsheet) with change history.
3. Assign owners to each proof artifact and schedule initial refresh tasks.
4. Baseline internal KPIs (even if approximate) to replace placeholders.
5. Integrate mapping review into existing bi-weekly product sync.
