## Cohort Lifecycle

```text
Recruit → Assess → Onboard Sprint → Core Curriculum → Applied Project → Deployment → Advancement / Alumni
```

### 1. Recruit

- Channels: University veteran centers, LinkedIn groups, partner nonprofits, referrals.
- Artifacts: Recruiting one-pager, application form, FAQ.
- KPI: Qualified applicants / outreach.

### 2. Assess

- Components: Aptitude (logic + data reasoning), Motivation interview, Baseline technical screen.
- Exit Criteria: Score thresholds + mission alignment pass.
- KPI: Pass rate, assessment cycle time.

### 3. Onboard Sprint (Week 0-1)

- Focus: Toolchain setup, security & compliance briefing, data ethics.
- Deliverable: Environment validated checklist.
- KPI: % cohort production-ready by end of week 1.

### 4. Core Curriculum (Weeks 2-6)

| Module | Theme                                         | Outcome Artifact                |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |

| M2     | Secure Data Handling & Governance             | Access pattern diagram          |
| M3     | Transformations & Lineage                     | Versioned pipeline mini-project |
| M4     | Analytics Patterns (Descriptive → Diagnostic) | Comparative metric notebook     |
| M5     | API Contracts & Integration                   | OpenAPI contract extension PR   |
| M6     | Mission Scenario Sprint                       | Insight brief deck              |

### 5. Applied Project (Weeks 7-10)

- Team: 2–3 cohort members + mentor.
- Scope: Realistic mission-aligned dataset (synthetic or anonymized).
- Milestones: Proposal → Midpoint review → Final impact brief.
- KPIs: On-time milestone %, mentor satisfaction rating.

### 6. Deployment (Weeks 11-12)

- Shadow to contribution: Pair with production feature / report.
- Deliverable: Logged first accepted PR OR validated analytic insight.
- KPI: % achieving production contribution within 14 days.

### 7. Advancement / Alumni

- Paths: Analyst → Senior Analyst → Data Engineer → Architect.
- Mechanisms: Skill badges, portfolio reviews, leadership shadow.
- KPIs: Promotion rate, alumni referral rate.

## Integration with Go-To-Market

- Cohort project outputs generate anonymized proof artifacts.
- Alumni participate in capability briefings (credibility layer).
- Success metrics (ramp, impact) feed messaging pillars.

---

## Immediate Actions

1. Finalize assessment rubric & weighting.
2. Create environment readiness checklist (Week 1 deliverable).
3. Draft module M1 & M2 facilitator guides.
4. Stand up lightweight skill tracking sheet (temp before LMS integration).
5. Define mentor onboarding and selection criteria.
