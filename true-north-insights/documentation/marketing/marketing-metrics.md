## Risk Flags & Leading Indicators
| Risk | Leading Indicator | Mitigation |
|------|------------------|------------|
| Slow pilot acquisition | < 1 SAT lead / month | Increase OSDBU cadence, refine messaging |
| Low demo → pilot conversion | < 20% | Improve demo script, add metrics proof | 
| Veteran hiring lag | < 30% after 2 hires | Engage university pipeline earlier |
| Whitepaper underperformance | < 10 downloads / month | Launch co-marketing or webinar |

## Quarterly Review Checklist
- Validate baselines vs. actuals
- Retire stale KPIs; introduce stage-specific ones (e.g., retention, ARR later)
- Compare conversion funnel: Lead → Demo → Proposal → Award
- Reallocate time if any KPI flat two consecutive quarters
