  2. Integrates via clear API contract + modular deployment.
  3. Enhances small business utilization metrics with mission-aligned talent.
- Proof: Draft integration diagram, OpenAPI spec, veteran talent cohort stats.
- CTA: Co-sell discovery / map to active pursuits.

### P4 – Data / Analytics Technical Lead

- Pains: Fragmented data stores, fragile pipelines, slow iteration under compliance constraints.
- Positioning: A resilient dual persistence architecture enabling rapid analytic iteration without sacrificing governance.
- Key Messages:
  1. Clear lineage & reproducibility baked in (versioned transformations).
  2. Performance patterns proven across mixed workload shapes.
  3. Extensible contract-first APIs for downstream integration.
- Proof: Architecture deep dive, performance benchmark, generated OpenAPI types.
- CTA: Technical architecture review session.

### P5 – Cyber / Security Reviewer

- Pains: Control mapping ambiguity, risk of unmanaged data sprawl, audit complexity.
- Positioning: Transparent, principle-of-least-privilege data platform with explicit control surface and auditable pipelines.
- Key Messages:
  1. Segmented data zones + enforced access patterns.
  2. Comprehensive logging / lineage metadata for audit readiness.
  3. Secure code + dependency posture (scans, SBOM plan).
- Proof: Security architecture doc, dependency scan report, logging schema excerpt.
- CTA: Security control mapping walkthrough.

### P6 – Veteran Talent Partner / University Lead

- Pains: Need compelling applied pathways, skill translation gaps, inconsistent placement feedback loops.
- Positioning: A mission-first applied analytics pathway converting veteran aptitude into measurable federal impact roles.
- Key Messages:
  1. Cohort-based learning anchored in real federal data use cases.
  2. Mentorship and outcome tracking to demonstrate placement impact.
  3. Clear advancement lattice (analyst → engineer → architect track).
- Proof: Cohort curriculum outline, early placement stats, mentor roster snapshot.
- CTA: Explore partnership / nominate candidates.

### P7 – Product Champion (Operational User)

- Pains: Manual data stitching, lagging dashboards, unclear insight provenance.
- Positioning: Intuitive, traceable insight workflows reducing manual steps while boosting confidence in decisions.
- Key Messages:
  1. Pre-built workflow accelerators (queries, transformations, viz patterns).
  2. Contextual lineage panel builds trust in each metric.
  3. Rapid iteration loop with feedback capture inside the workflow.
- Proof: Prototype workflow demo, lineage UI mock, user feedback snippets.
- CTA: Join pilot feedback session.
