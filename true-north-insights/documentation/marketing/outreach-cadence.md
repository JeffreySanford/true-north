# Outreach Cadence Plan

> Purpose: Establish a disciplined, compounding rhythm of federal and ecosystem touchpoints that feeds the top of funnel, advances positioned opportunities, and reinforces our differentiated mission brand (data-driven veteran enablement + secure dual-persistence architecture).

---

## Guiding Principles

1. Consistency beats intensity – unmissable weekly rhythm.
2. Every touchpoint logs a metric (contact, stage, intent, next action) into CRM/airtable.
3. Blend value-first education (insights, benchmarks) with credibility signals (partners, veteran talent outcomes).
4. Reuse > reinvent: Each core asset is atomized (long-form → slide → snippet → social → nurture).
5. Always capture a CTA: subscribe, schedule capability briefing, join beta, talent referral.

## CRM / Data Hygiene Rules

- Every outbound logged within 24h (contact id, segment, intent tag, next action date).
- Stale leads (>21d no touch) auto-flagged for recycle sequence.
- Mandatory fields: Segment, Stage, Source Asset, Last Touch Type.
- Duplicate detection run weekly.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Validate baseline KPIs with actual historic data (replace assumptions).
2. Stand up lightweight CRM schema (or Airtable base) with mandatory fields.
3. Produce first benchmark snippet + atomize into 3 derivative assets.
4. Schedule first two capability briefings (target distinct personas).
5. Launch stale-lead flagging script prototype.
