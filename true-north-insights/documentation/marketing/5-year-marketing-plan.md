# True North Insights – Expanded 5-Year Plan

## Page 1 – Executive Summary (Expanded)

### Who We Are

True North Insights is more than a veteran-led consulting company; we are a movement rooted in Jamestown, North Dakota. Founded by veterans and patriots, we combine cutting-edge technology with the values of discipline, service, and accountability. Our mission is simple yet powerful: **We are legendary** — building secure, innovative, real-time solutions that strengthen government, empower veterans, and uplift local communities.

Brand Architecture: Company = True North Insights (parent). Public website/campaign shorthand = "True North Insight".

### Core Value Proposition

- **Veteran employment focus:** Targeting 90% veteran employment, creating a sustainable transition pathway into technology careers.
- **Specialists in real-time systems:** Dashboards, auditing, and time/accountability platforms built with Angular + NestJS + RxJS hot observables.
- **Agile federal delivery:** Positioned to win micro-purchases (≤ $15k) and Simplified Acquisition Threshold contracts (< $250k) where speed and clarity win, with complete-delivery MVP packages and a client Planning View for transparent execution.
- **Community-driven impact:** Anchored in North Dakota universities, meetups, and veteran networks – multiplying economic and social resilience.

## Page 2 – Market Analysis (Expanded)

### Federal Opportunity Landscape

- **Micro-purchase & SAT contracts:** Agencies urgently need modernization pilots under $250k. These are testbed projects where a veteran-led team with a finished MVP can win quickly.
- **Set-aside pathways (SDVOSB, VOSB, 8(a)):** Future certifications open multimillion-dollar sole-source channels. Until then, subcontracting via primes with inclusion mandates accelerates traction.
- **Veteran transition narrative:** Branding as a pipeline of trained veteran developers positions True North as both a vendor and workforce development partner.

### Target Agencies

- **USACE / DoD:** Modernization dashboards, supply chain visibility, operational readiness.
- **VA / HHS:** Real-time auditing, compliance systems, workforce training integration.
- **OMB / GAO:** Accountability dashboards for government performance oversight.
- **DHS / FEMA:** Incident response & rapid visualization platforms.

### Competitive Advantage

- We do not simply bill hours — **we deliver finished, veteran-built MVPs**.
- Patriotic accountability brand resonates with federal mission owners.
- North Dakota roots = small, approachable, dependable ("North Dakota Nice").
- Unique dual mission: build software AND train veterans into the federal tech workforce.
