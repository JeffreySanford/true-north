## 1. Executive Abstract

A veteran-focused rural revitalization and workforce acceleration program centered in Jamestown, North Dakota. The accelerator fuses employment, transitional housing, and deep civic integration to create a repeatable blueprint for stabilizing and scaling a mission-aligned technical workforce serving federal, state, and community innovation needs.

## 2. Strategic Thesis

- Veterans possess disciplined execution capacity under-leveraged in analytics & real-time systems.
- Rural hubs can attract and retain talent when bundled with structured housing + community mission identity.
- A place-based pipeline (Jamestown) + capability engine (True North Insights) + civic partners = durable social & economic impact.
