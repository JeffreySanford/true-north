---

## Page 1 – Executive Summary

**Who We Are**  
True North Insights is a veteran-led, pro-American technology and consulting company based in Jamestown, North Dakota. Our mission is simple: *We are legendary* — delivering secure, innovative, real-time solutions to government and defense partners under $250K contracts, where speed, accountability, and value matter most.

**Core Value Proposition**
- Veteran-led, small business preference for federal contracting.  
- Specialized in **real-time data visualization**, **Forge-Board (Kanban + metrics)**, and **Time-Forge (time tracking + accountability)**.  
- Agile enough for **micro-purchases ($15k)** and **Simplified Acquisition Threshold contracts** (recently raised above $250k).  
- Transparent, patriotic branding and a focus on accountability — aligning with agencies’ modernization and compliance missions.

## Page 2 – Market Analysis

**Federal Opportunity Landscape**
- **Micro-purchase ($15k)** and **SAT (<$250k)** buys are fast-track awards. Agencies use them for modernization pilots and proofs of concept.  
- **Set-aside programs (SDVOSB, VOSB, 8(a))** allow sole-source awards up to several million. Even without certifications yet, agencies *must* consider small business set-asides for buys above SAT.  
- **Hidden subcontracting market**: Most opportunities never hit SAM.gov. Prime contractors with subcontracting plans are required to bring in small businesses — a huge pipeline for us.  

**Target Agencies**
- **USACE / DoD**: modernization pilots, dashboarding, data governance.  
- **VA / HHS**: real-time auditing, compliance reporting.  
- **OMB / GAO**: performance dashboards, auditing tools.  
- **Homeland Security / FEMA**: rapid data visualization, incident response dashboards.  

**Competitive Advantage**
- Many small vendors offer dev services. True North Insights distinguishes itself by:  
  - Veteran-led brand with patriotic, pro-accountability ethos.  
  - Tight focus on **real-time, observable dashboards**.  
  - Ability to deliver **MVP pilots in 30–90 days** at fixed-price.
