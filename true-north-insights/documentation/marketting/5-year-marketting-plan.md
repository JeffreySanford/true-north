## Page 2 ‚Äì Market Analysis

### Federal Opportunity Landscape

- **Micro-purchase ($15k)** and **SAT (<$250k)** buys are fast-track awards. Agencies use them for modernization pilots and proofs of concept.  
- **Set-aside programs (SDVOSB, VOSB, 8(a))** allow sole-source awards up to several million. Even without certifications yet, agencies *must* consider small business set-asides for buys above SAT.  
- **Hidden subcontracting market**: Most opportunities never hit SAM.gov. Prime contractors with subcontracting plans are required to bring in small businesses ‚Äî a huge pipeline for us.  

### Target Agencies

- **USACE / DoD**: modernization pilots, dashboarding, data governance.  
- **VA / HHS**: real-time auditing, compliance reporting.  
- **OMB / GAO**: performance dashboards, auditing tools.  
- **Homeland Security / FEMA**: rapid data visualization, incident response dashboards.  

### Competitive Advantage

- Many small vendors offer dev services. True North Insights distinguishes itself by:  
  - Veteran-led brand with patriotic, pro-accountability ethos.  
  - Tight focus on **real-time, observable dashboards**.  
  - Ability to deliver **MVP pilots in 30‚Äì90 days** at fixed-price.
