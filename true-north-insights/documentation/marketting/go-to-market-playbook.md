## 1. Vision & Mission (Strategic Horizon)

Source: `5-year-marketting-plan.md`

**Mission:** Become America’s Veteran Tech Company — legendary solutions, veteran-built, real-time ready.

### Core Axes

- Real-time systems (Forge-Board, Time-Forge, Blockchain Auditing)
- Veteran workforce (90% veteran employment, True North Academy)
- Federal contracting growth (Micro-purchase, SAT awards, set-asides)
- Community & fraternal impact (ND universities, meetups, distance learning, Elks, Legion, VFW, Rotary, Lions, DAV, Team Rubicon)
