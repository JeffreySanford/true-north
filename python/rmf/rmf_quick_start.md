## 2 Â· RMF Steps & Key Tasks

The Risk Management Framework provides a structured process for implementing security controls and managing risk.
True North's approach brings North Dakota's legendary precision to each step of the process.

| Step | Task Summary | Control | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Prepare** | Define SCRM policy and SAFe roles | P-1 | Mission-focused security strategy with North Dakota reliability |
| **Categorize** | FIPSâ€‘199 MOD â†’ FedRAMP Moderate | C-1 | Appropriate controls for information sensitivity |
| **Select** | Tailor baseline-remove PEâ€‘6, add SCâ€‘23 mobile admin | S-1 | Right-sized security without unnecessary overhead |
| **Implement** | IaC + GitLab CI; controls as code | I-2 | Automated compliance with every deployment |
| **Assess** | Internal 3PAO using InSpec & e2e tests | A-1 | Continuous validation of security posture |
| **Authorize** | FedRAMP 20x JSON evidence to AO | A-2 | Accelerated approval for mission delivery |
| **Monitor** | WebSocket telemetry to hashâ€‘ledger; PIâ€‘based POA&M | M-1 | Real-time security visibility with integrity |

See the **RMF Implementation Guide** for detailed instructions on completing each step with True North's methodology.


---- 
 **Problem :** Paper control matrices slow FedRAMP packages and delay critical missions. 
 **Solution :** Evidence exported in OSCAL JSON and hashâ€‘ledger with automated verification from America's heartland. 
 **Benefit :** Connects directly to FedRAMP 20x automated queue, reducing ATO time by 83% with North Dakota precision.

 ### Baseline & Control Tailoring
 Starting from **FedRAMP Moderate**; tailoring decisions captured in `controls-tailor.xlsx` with justifications for each modification.

 True North's approach applies military precision and heartland integrity to each control implementation:

 - **Control Inheritance** - Maximize reuse from existing infrastructure
 - **Control Implementation** - Automate through CI/CD pipelines with validation
 - **Evidence Collection** - Continuous monitoring with cryptographic integrity
 - **Documentation** - Clear, concise language with straightforward explanations
