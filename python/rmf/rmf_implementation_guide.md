## Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions for implementing the Risk Management Framework (RMF) using True North's 
methodology, which combines military precision with North Dakota's legendary commitment to excellence. This document
supplements the RMF Quick Start guide and provides step-by-step instructions for each phase of the RMF process.

### How to Use This Guide

1. Start by reviewing the RMF Quick Start document for an overview of the process
2. Follow the detailed instructions in this guide for each RMF step
3. Use the provided templates and checklists to ensure comprehensive implementation
4. Contact True North's support team with any questions

## RMF Implementation Steps

### Prepare Phase

The Prepare phase establishes the foundation for the following activities and deliverables:

- Document system boundaries with precision using network diagrams
- Establish clear roles and responsibilities for security governance
- Develop Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) policy before procurement
- True North Tip: Integrate SAFe program increment planning with security milestones

**Key Documentation:**

- System Boundary Diagram
- SCRM Policy Document
- Roles & Responsibilities Matrix
- SAFe Program Increment Plan

### Categorize Phase

The Categorize phase establishes the foundation for the following activities and deliverables:

- Use FIPS 199 worksheets to analyze impact levels for CIA triad
- Document all information types processed by the system
- Consider privacy impacts alongside security categorization
- True North Tip: Map information flows between subsystems to identify hidden dependencies

**Key Documentation:**

- FIPS 199 Categorization Worksheet
- Information Types Register
- Privacy Impact Assessment
- Data Flow Diagrams

### Select Phase

The Select phase establishes the foundation for the following activities and deliverables:

- Start with FedRAMP Moderate baseline for most federal systems
- Document all control tailoring decisions with clear justifications
- Consider hybrid controls that span multiple systems
- True North Tip: Use our control inheritance matrix to maximize reuse of existing controls

**Key Documentation:**

- Control Selection Workbook
- Tailoring Justification Memo
- Inheritance and Hybrid Control Documentation
- Control Implementation Statement Templates

### Implement Phase

The Implement phase establishes the foundation for the following activities and deliverables:

- Prioritize implementation of technical controls that can be automated
- Document configurations in machine-readable formats
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for repeatable deployments
- True North Tip: Our GitLab CI templates automate 85% of control verification

**Key Documentation:**

- System Security Plan (SSP)
- Configuration Management Plan
- Automated Testing Scripts
- IaC Templates
- CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

### Assess Phase

The Assess phase establishes the foundation for the following activities and deliverables:

- Develop assessment procedures before implementation begins
- Use continuous monitoring tools to gather evidence automatically
- Track findings in a centralized POA&M management system
- True North Tip: Our hash-ledger provides cryptographic proof of control testing

**Key Documentation:**

- Security Assessment Plan (SAP)
- Testing Procedures
- Assessment Scripts and Tools
- Evidence Collection Templates
- Findings Register

### Authorize Phase

The Authorize phase establishes the foundation for the following activities and deliverables:

- Prepare executive summary of system risks for authorizing official
- Use FedRAMP templates for authorization packages
- Document residual risk acceptance clearly
- True North Tip: Our OSCAL JSON exports speed authorization by 83%

**Key Documentation:**

- Security Assessment Report (SAR)
- Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)
- Risk Assessment Report
- ATO Request Letter
- Executive Summary for AO

### Monitor Phase

The Monitor phase establishes the foundation for the following activities and deliverables:

- Implement automated scanning on a continuous basis
- Establish metrics for ongoing security effectiveness
- Set clear thresholds for risk acceptance and escalation
- True North Tip: Our real-time dashboards show compliance status with military precision

**Key Documentation:**

- Continuous Monitoring Strategy
- Automated Scanning Configuration
- Metric Dashboards Setup
- POA&M Management Process
- Incident Response Integration

## True North's RMF Accelerators

True North Insights offers several accelerators that can speed your RMF implementation:

### 1. Control Implementation Statements Library

Our pre-written control implementation statements cover the complete FedRAMP Moderate baseline.
Each statement is:
- Written in clear, assessor-friendly language
- Technically accurate and implementation-neutral
- Designed for easy customization to your environment

### 2. Document Templates

- System Security Plan (SSP) Template with OSCAL export capability
- Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) and Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)
- Incident Response Plan with tabletop exercise scenarios
- Contingency Plan template with BIA worksheet

### 3. Automation Tools

- GitLab CI/CD Templates for control validation
- Docker-based scanning tools pre-configured for FedRAMP requirements
- Terraform modules for compliant infrastructure
- Python scripts for generating OSCAL JSON evidence

### 4. Assessment Tools

- Control testing procedures mapped to NIST SP 800-53A
- Evidence collection checklist by control family
- POA&M tracking system with risk scoring
- RMF readiness assessment toolkit

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Scope Creep
**Problem:** System boundaries expand during implementation, invalidating security documentation. 
**Solution:** Document and control boundaries clearly at the start; use configuration management to track changes.

### Insufficient Evidence
**Problem:** Controls are implemented but evidence is inadequate for assessment. 
**Solution:** Design evidence collection into implementation; use True North's evidence matrix to ensure completeness.

### Control Conflicts
**Problem:** Some security controls conflict with operational requirements. 
**Solution:** Identify conflicts early and document risk-based decisions for alternative implementations.

### Policy-Practice Gap
**Problem:** Written policies don't match actual practices. 
**Solution:** Develop policies based on implementable practices; update both in tandem.
