- Python 3.8+ (for documentation tools)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   
3. For documentation tools, install additional dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r python/requirements.txt
   ```

## Run Tasks

```sh
npx nx serve true-north-insights
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build true-north-insights
```
