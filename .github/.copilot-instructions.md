# Craft Fusion - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
Craft Fusion is an Nx monorepo project with Angular frontends and multiple backend services written in NestJS and Go. The project leverages a high-performance development environment with modern web technologies and microservice architecture.

## Development Environment
- **Hardware**: i7 processor, 32GB RAM, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed
- **Monorepo**: Nx workspace for managing multiple applications and libraries
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub
- **Package Manager**: npm/yarn for JavaScript/TypeScript dependencies, go modules for Go dependencies
- **Node.js**: Latest LTS version
- **Development IDE**: VS Code with recommended extensions for Angular, NestJS, and Go development

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
- `/apps/` - Contains all applications (frontend and backend)
- `/libs/` - Shared libraries and modules
- `/tools/` - Build and development tools
- `/docs/` - Project documentation

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Angular 19+
- **UI Library**: Material Design 3
- **State Management**: NgRx/NGXS
- **CSS**: SCSS with BEM methodology
- **Reactive Programming**: RxJS
- **Localization**: Angular i18n
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### Backend
- **NestJS Services**:
    - TypeScript-based
    - REST and GraphQL APIs
    - TypeORM/Mongoose for database access
    - JWT authentication
    - Swagger for API documentation
    
- **Go Services**:
    - Go 1.20+
    - Gin/Echo/Fiber framework
    - GORM for database access
    - High-performance microservices
    - gRPC for service-to-service communication

- **Planned Java Spring Boot Services**:
    - Spring Boot 3.x
    - Spring Security
    - Spring Data JPA
    - Kotlin support

### Database
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- MongoDB for document storage
- Redis for caching
- Elasticsearch for search functionality

## Coding Standards

### General
- Follow clean code principles
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Document all public APIs
- Follow SOLID principles
- Write unit tests for all new code

### Angular
- NX workspace structure, use NX generators for creating components, services, and libraries
- Lazy loading for routes
- OnPush change detection when possible
- This is a modular, strongly typed, loosely coupled architecture that prefers RXJS Hot Observable streams over Async Promises.
- This extensively uses sockets to distribute small details of data and RESTful APIs for larger data sets.
- Standalone components are not allowed and in Angular 19+ standalone: false is required.
- Follow Angular style guide
- Never use signals, keep business logic in the component and use services for data fetching
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

#### Materdial Design 3
- Use Angular Material components
- Follow Material Design guidelines
- Use SCSS for styling
- Implement responsive design with Flex Layout
- Use Angular CDK for custom components
- Use Angular animations for transitions

### NestJS
- Use dependency injection
- Create modular services
- Implement proper exception filters
- Use interceptors for cross-cutting concerns
- Follow RESTful API design principles for large data sets and sockets for small data sets
- Use DTOs for data validation
- Use Pipes for data transformation
- Use Guards for authentication and authorization
- Use Swagger for API documentation
- Use class-validator and class-transformer for DTO validation
- Use Mongoose Schemas for MongoDB models

### Go
- Follow Go style guide and idioms
- Use context for cancellation
- Implement proper error handling
- Use interfaces for abstraction
- Follow standard project layout

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with Jest/Go testing package
- E2E tests with Cypress/Playwright
- API tests with Supertest/Postman
- Visual regression testing
- Performance testing with k6
- Accessibility testing

## CI/CD
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- Nx affected commands for targeted building and testing
- Docker containers for deployments
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Automated versioning and releases

## Performance Considerations
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Use Angular ahead-of-time compilation
- Optimize bundle sizes
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Leverage hardware acceleration with CUDA for compute-intensive tasks
- Consider WebAssembly for performance-critical code
- Implement proper database indexing

## Security Guidelines
- Follow OWASP top 10 security practices
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Regularly update dependencies
- Implement Content Security Policy
- Use HTTPS everywhere

## Common Workflows
1. Creating new features:
     - Create feature library in libs
     - Implement components/services
     - Write unit tests
     - Integrate with application

2. API development:
     - Define DTOs/models
     - Implement controllers/endpoints
     - Write service logic
     - Document with Swagger/OpenAPI
     - Test endpoints

3. Deployment:
     - Merge to main branch
     - Trigger CI/CD pipeline
     - Run tests
     - Build artifacts
     - Deploy to environment

## Future Roadmap
- Integration of Java Spring Boot services
- Migration to Angular 20 when available
- Enhanced AI features with CUDA acceleration
- Improved build performance using distributed caching
- Implementation of micro-frontends architecture
